        <p class="lead mb-4"><p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Jenna Sasaki and I am a first year Business Administration Major at the University of California Riverside. In the future, I plan on concentrating in Management, in hopes to pursue the field of Human Resource Management. While I still want to research more of the other concentrations UC Riverside has to offer, management has always been one I am interested in.<br><br>
I was born and raised in San Diego, California alongside my older sister, twin brother, and parents. Growing up, I attended weekly Sunday services at the Buddhist Temple of San Diego with my family and relatives. I played many sports growing up and excelled in Track in Field during my four years of high school. Some other extracurricular activities I participated in included Save the Earth Club, Link Crew, Fight Against Hunger, and Humanitarian Outreach Club. While balancing these activities, I worked as a shift leader at a local bubble tea franchise: Kung Fu Tea located in Carmel Mountain Ranch. During my senior year of high school, I really got a feel for how to allocate my time and plan accordingly to different commitments.<br><br>
At UC Riverside, I am involved in the UC Riverside Nikkei Student Union, where Japanese American culture can be shared with allies of the community. Next year, I will be serving on the general board as the Social Chair, planning icebreakers, games, socials, retreats, and more! I also plan on becoming more involved in the Undergraduate Business Association, learning more about business strategies and career opportunities. Next year, I am planning on working as a Resident Housing Ambassador in the Resident Service Offices here at UCR. In this position, I will be serving my peers by distributing packages, sorting mail, providing resources on campus, and working with other Residential Staff. Being involved in the on-campus community is so important to me, as it helps me become more close-knit with the residents and students on campus<br><br>
With work experience gained over the past few years, I got the opportunity to learn what it is like working in a fast paced environment. In this type of atmosphere, being able to provide quality service efficiently is key. Customer service has always been a strength of mine, as I love to work and communicate with other people. I have always been a very friendly and social person, loving to meet new people and make friends. Implementing this skill into Human Resources, I hope to help foster a welcoming, safe, and most importantly efficient workplaces where all employees of any race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, and background can perform their best. Healthy employee relations in the workplace is essential to running successful businesses.<br><br>
On this page, you will learn more about my work experience, skills, and involvements. Attached is my Resume where you can look deeper into my background. Please feel free to reach out to me using my contact information provided on this page. If you have any questions, comments or feedback, please let me know. Thank you!</p>
